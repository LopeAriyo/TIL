# Today I Learned

In the spirit of learning publicly I've started a TIL repo to document the bits of knowledge I gain every (working) day about languages and technologies either through self-study or from colleagues. This repo was inspired by [Josh Branchaud's TIL](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til)

The hope with my TIL is to summarise a topic in 250 words or less so that files are readable and upkeep doesn't feel tedious.

Note: I started this part of my personal documentation because I realised how much I didn't write down at my first role. There are many things I remember and can do without thinking however there is also some knowledge I've lost because I didn't practice those things often enough. Therefore this repo isn't a direct representation of everything I know.
